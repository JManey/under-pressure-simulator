☐ This is a game about refining one chemical into another, by adjusting rate and temperature.  There are two levels.  The first has two adjustments and one output which is measured as quality.  The second has three adjustments and two outputs which are also measured as quality.

☐ Getting Started: 
    Upon starting the game, the process will already be started.  Your job is to use adjust the sliders to get the output quality as close as you can to 100%.

☐ User stories:
* As a user, I want to see direction for how to play the game        quickly.
* As a user, I want easy to use inputs, because I don't time to      learn a complicated system.
* As a user, I want to see see my progress/tell if I won, because I'm competitive.
    
☐ Next Steps => Future addons/spin-offs:  I think this game would be even better if made into a chemistry experiment.  I would keep the temperature controls to operate a bunsen burner.  And adjust the flow control to "pour" chemical into another chemical.  Add a titrating tube that you would click per drop.  All of this would need to be animated/click and drag.  Plus it should be realistic.  The titrating chemicals such as silver nitrate and Phenolphthalein should react
